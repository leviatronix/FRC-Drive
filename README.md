A mobile version of the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®) Driver Station. This app will allow one to connect to a robot and drive it through an Android device. This app is an open beta and still prone to bugs. I am planning on adding more features as time goes on. I would gladly take suggestions for improvements. I am an Alumni and Mentor for FRC® Team 2059 The Hitchhikers.
This project is open source: https://github.com/AquaMorph/FRC-Drive

**Disclaimer:** This app is unofficial and I am not responsible for any problems that result from this app.

**Features:**
* Simplistic Holo Interface
* Teleop and Autonomous modes
* Two onscreen joysticks and throttles with full 12 buttons each
